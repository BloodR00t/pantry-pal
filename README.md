## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, React Hook Form, React Router  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript  
**Database:** MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=18.0.0`
- A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account and cluster

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies for the root, client, and server in one command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BloodR00t/pantry-pal.git
cd pantry-pal
npm run install-all
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` directory:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Then open `server/.env` and fill in your values:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=3000
```

You can find your MongoDB connection string in Atlas under **Database → Connect → Connect your application**. Make sure to include your database name in the URI:

```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/your-database-name?appName=Cluster0
```

### Running the Application

From the project root, run both the client and server concurrently:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The client will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and the server at `http://localhost:3000`.

To run them separately:

```bash
npm run client   # frontend only
npm run server   # backend only
```

## Usage

1. **View your pantry** — The main view displays all items currently in your inventory.
2. **Add an item** — Use the form to add a new pantry item including name, quantity, and other details.

## Roadmap

See the [Features](#features) table above for planned additions.

Low stock alerts, barcode scanning, and recipe suggestions are planned for future iterations.
